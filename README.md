# Foody

Foody is an app that uses the FourSquare APIs to fetch some restaurants near the user's current location.
The app provides the user an option to mark a place as disliked which won't be displayed on further use of the app.
The user can also search for venues from the search bar.
Clicking on a Venue opens the details for the said Venue.

Once on the details Screen, the app displays the location of the venue on a map with an option for getting the directions to get there.

The app uses MVVM architecture and generics across the network layer for handlng responses.
